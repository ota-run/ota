# Env Resolution and Policy

Ota already supports declaring env requirements in `ota.yaml`.

This future surface adds policy-controlled resolution and injection so repos and
workspaces can explain where env values came from without becoming a full app config
system.

Use it for:

- required runtime env
- approved source resolution
- consistent execution injection
- provenance-aware receipts
