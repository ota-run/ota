# Current Ota Development State

Update this file at a completed implementation, pressure, release, or handoff boundary. Replace
stale state; do not turn it into an activity log. Durable decisions belong in `docs/adr/` and
durable agent workflow belongs in the canonical Ota skill.

## Active Work

- branch: `1.6.24-implementation`
- released baseline: `v1.6.23`
- active implementation and proof slice: `V11.10` replay trust refinement; `ota up
  --replay-baseline ... --json` now carries replay-authored baseline posture directly through
  `replay.baseline.last_known_good`, while declared static replay inputs remain receipt
  `evaluated_inputs[]` and Bedrock-style historical query traces stay separate as attested
  `witnessed_observations.query_traces[]`; plain-text replay output now mirrors the same trust
  split by rendering matched acquitting, narrowing, and pointer-only evidence separately from
  changed inputs, and hermeticity now requires at least one matched material runtime,
  dependency-resolution, or presentation anchor rather than over-reading same-contract reruns as
  hermetic; hidden-input replay failure now emits ordered `hidden_input_candidates` so operators
  can promote the next likely ambient class instead of reading one generic suspicion bucket
- active implementation and proof slice: `V11.11` seam and negative-control evidence. Runtime
  proof now keeps ordinary reachability and caller-side attempts distinct from marker-bound seam
  exercise. A selected negative control names one observed seam obligation and typed expected
  failure; only a runner-verified, transaction-bound failure attestation can validate the control
  and promote that exact record to `fault_tested`. Canonical control output now carries a
  contract-declared intervention identity and runner-derived failure mode: only
  `expected_obligation_failed` with `expected_missing_effect` validates; generic non-zero exits
  remain `invalid`. Exercised seams without a validated control carry
  `dependency_causality_not_proved`, while fault-tested seams retain
  `dependency_output_shaping_not_proved` keyed to the declared seam obligation. Text and JSON
  preserve the evidence level, origin, authority class, control status, failure classification,
  and causal-depth boundary for operators.
- active lifecycle hardening: native commands and persistent-service wrappers now forward
  interruption only into their owned child tree. This removes inherited-process-group signalling
  from runtime-proof teardown, which previously could cancel the surrounding GitHub Actions shell
  on Athena's native proof lane. The focused and full library regressions pass locally; the next
  gate is a fresh Athena matrix from the pushed implementation branch.
- active V11.11 pressure gate: Athena API carries the first Rails/PostgreSQL fault-attested
  control under the marker-bound `app-proof` workflow. The prior `app`-only non-zero control proof
  is historical evidence only. Its green transaction-bound matrix proved the warning-only runtime
  admission and same-orchestrator sibling callback fixes across the selected Ubuntu proof lane.
  Bedrock and Lead Quorum also remain green on their declared native/container compatibility
  lanes. Local Athena macOS proof remains host-blocked by Brew `libpq` fulfillment, so it must
  not be mistaken for a negative-control result.

- V11.10 Bedrock replay proves native baseline replay as `replay_verified` and `partly_ambient`.
  A container replay against that native archive correctly returns `replay_unavailable` with
  `baseline_scope_mismatch`: workflow, backend, provider, remote target, and lifecycle identity are
  required for `last_known_good`.
  A freshly archived container witness then replays as `replay_verified` and `partly_ambient` on
  the same container/ephemeral scope. Backend-scoped informational doctor notes remain visible but
  do not stale an otherwise same-scope witness.

## Recent Completed Slice

- Kylrix pressure exposed two connected Ota execution gaps and proved their fixes on the
  deterministic SQLite contributor lane. `launch.runtime_projection.adapter: nextjs` now
  projects `--hostname` / `--port` from the runtime listener into direct `next dev` launches,
  while validation rejects package-script wrappers that would make projection ambiguous. Dry-run
  input resolution now recognizes `ensure_env_file` output from the selected dependency closure as
  planned setup state on a clean checkout, while real execution waits for dependencies and then
  validates the rendered dotenv input. Published contract-schema coverage was synchronized for
  command runtime projection and already-shipped generated workflow-instance fields; the full
  examples gate now passes. Kylrix itself proves idempotent SQLite env materialization, agent-safe
  Vitest/lint/build verification, workflow preparation, archived receipt, and isolated native
  runtime proof. Its interactive Appwrite topology and credential/schema-provisioning paths remain
  explicitly outside this narrow proof.

- Kylrix also exposed a native long-running task UX gap: applications such as Next.js can exit
  non-zero after a user `Ctrl+C`. Explicit runner interruption evidence, or a raw signal before a
  clean completion, returns canonical exit `130` with an `interrupted` receipt and summary. A late
  raw signal cannot overwrite an already-established non-interrupt task or service failure.

- Dagger generated-SDK pressure exposed and fixed native source-managed tool activation: a
  release-asset tool was fulfilled and version-probed correctly, but the native shell task path
  discarded the managed PATH before executing its command. Ota now applies the resolved PATH to
  native shell execution and has a focused regression test. The narrowed Dagger contract proves
  release-asset fulfillment, workflow preparation, selected generator execution, generated-source
  lineage, a clean consumer diff, scoped doctor, and archived receipt locally. The selected
  closure requires Dagger v0.21.7 despite root `dagger.json` still naming v0.21.0; that is
  recorded as repo truth rather than hidden by the pressure contract.

- Task platform availability is now contract-owned. `tasks.<name>.only_on` uses the same
  `linux` / `macos` / `windows` vocabulary as prerequisite and context scope; runner planning,
  `ota run`, and dry-run preview refuse an unsupported dependency closure before side effects.
  `ota tasks --use` marks context- or task-unavailable modes non-callable, and doctor filters
  unavailable closures before probing their requirements. Athena pressure uses this truth through
  its Linux/macOS Ruby context and proves the expected Windows refusal rather than hiding it with
  a workflow skip.

- The current V11.10 refinement adds contract-owned
  `tasks.<name>.witnessed_observations.query_traces[]` for existing JSONL query traces. Ota
  validates immutable repo-relative trace paths, captures the selected closure before execution,
  and emits source identity, full run records, and divergent-subject summary under receipt
  `witnessed_observations`. It deliberately keeps the trace outside `evaluated_inputs[]` so
  historical observed behavior cannot be over-read as a current-run decision input. Bedrock's
  recorded SQL trace proves the narrow admission: three subjects diverge while stable repeated
  queries retain one identity across runs.
- The in-progress `V11.13` core cut makes generated source a named repo-scoped contract artifact:
  `artifacts.<name>` declares `kind: generated_source`, one producer task, output paths, and
  optional source inputs; consumers declare `requires_artifacts` and directly depend on the
  producer. Validation rejects dangling, overlapping, and dependency-disconnected lineage. The
  runner checks declared outputs after the producer closure and before consumers execute. Task
  JSON carries the producer map plus consumer references, and receipt `evaluated_inputs[]` captures
  producer/path/input lineage at issue time as pointer-only evidence, never as a freshness claim.
- EventCatalog pressure proved the first healthy generator and sibling-package consumer closure:
  typed `pnpm --filter @eventcatalog/language-server install`, Langium generation, and the
  downstream VS Code extension build. It also widened `prepare.source.filter` from its old
  browser-bootstrap-only boundary into a pnpm-owned dependency-hydration selector. The first
  sibling build failure identified real missing SDK and visualiser build dependencies; modeling
  those finite tasks made the final extension build pass without shell orchestration.
- Bedrock pressure proved the V11.10 replay-artifact shape on a deterministic offline NL-to-SQL
  stability harness across Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows: explicit script-test aggregation, committed
  SQL fixture replay, and the defended baseline gate all run in agent mode with no model key. Its
  live recording lane remains intentionally outside that claim because it reaches Claude, rewrites
  the fixture, and depends on an unpinned generic-pip requirements path that Ota does not yet own
  through typed dependency hydration.
- The current V11.10 replay carrier now distinguishes whether the selected baseline is still the
  last known good witness. `ota up --replay-baseline ... --json` adds
  `replay.baseline.last_known_good` with `replay_verified`, `stale_witness`, or `unavailable`
  derived from the replay result itself, so promoted archives no longer all read as equally
  current after drift or unavailable-baseline failures.
- The next V11.10 tightening names active execution governance as a replay-grade input too.
  Receipts now capture a loaded org policy pack as `policy_ruleset_identity`, and replay treats a
  changed ruleset as named input drift rather than generic hidden-input suspicion.
- The current V11.10 tightening also names declared env-source files when the selected lane
  actually resolved from them. Receipts capture `env_source_identity` without recording values, so
  replay can distinguish declared env-source drift from still-ambient process or policy env.

- The completed task-discovery UX batch renders closure-aware `Human Run`, `Agent Run`, and
  `Agent Policy` sections in `ota tasks` and `ota tasks --use`. It keeps the `ota-site` internal
  verification setup task agent-callable so its declared-safe public verification closures remain
  truthful without exposing setup in the default task inventory. Task mode rows now use stable
  `Container`, `Native`, then `Remote` presentation, show unsupported local planes explicitly,
  and recover native override support for container-context tasks without requiring a redundant
  task mode branch. `ota tasks --json` now carries the same canonical per-mode truth under
  `tasks[].use.modes[]`, while the existing `use.human` and `use.agent` remain selected-mode
  compatibility projections.
- `V11.11` contract-derived proof boundaries is implemented in Ota commit `e3bbdf02`.
  `ota proof runtime --json` now emits terminal `proof_verdict`, and Lead Quorum pressure proved
  `passed_with_unproven_boundaries` on the app lane across Ubuntu and macOS.
- The next `V11.11` tightening keeps that qualified proof boundary visible in human output too:
  `ota proof runtime` now renders concrete `Proof Boundaries` entries whenever `not_proved[]`
  exists, so external-network and broader-scope exclusions travel with the green proof instead of
  living only in JSON.
- The next `V11.11` refinement makes those proof boundaries machine-actionable too: each
  `not_proved` entry now carries an explicit `reason`, and the human proof render includes the
  same reason label for seam, adjacent-lane, and broader-scope exclusions.
- The current follow-on `V11.11` cut starts the first positive seam-evidence carrier on
  `ota proof runtime --json`: `dependency_evidence[]` now publishes runner-derived
  `level: reachable` only for declared service seams that are also on the selected
  workflow-owned required-service path and have structured readiness Ota actually owns. This
  keeps selected service reachability distinct from still-unproved exercised interaction.
- The next `V11.11` refinement keeps caller-side seam attempts separate from proved reachability:
  proof-derived DNS, auth, and loopback service failure signals can now publish additive
  `interaction_attempted: true` with `observation.origin: caller_side`, while the paired
  `dependency_exercise_not_proved` boundary tightens to `caller_side_only_evidence` instead of
  generic missing evidence.
- The same commit fixes detached native proof lifecycle ownership: nested `ota up --detach` leaves
  the service running for the outer proof to observe and clean up, preventing recursive teardown.
- V11.10 now emits an initial runner-derived receipt-comparison artifact-trust record for matching
  semantic contract snapshots. It is `acquitting` for `contract_truth` only; lockfile/runtime
  artifact capture remains the next implementation cut.
- The in-progress V11.10 cut captures declared lockfile-strict Node identity in
  `receipt.evaluated_inputs[]` at receipt authoring time: `pnpm-lock.yaml` for frozen pnpm and
  `package-lock.json` or authoritative `npm-shrinkwrap.json` for `npm ci`. It carries this through
  archived baseline and current receipt diff and labels only matching
  `declared_dependency_resolution` identity as `acquitting`. Directus and ota-site proved matching
  archived/current paths with the source-built binary; unrelated runtime findings remain separate.
- Lead Quorum is not yet the first hermetic replay target: its typed `uv pip_requirements` lane
  and Python range are real current repo truth, but not the pinned dependency/runtime pair V11.10
  needs. Treat that as a repo contract/replay-readiness gap, not a reason to weaken Ota evidence.
- The in-progress next cut captures `runtime:node` through contract-local `node --version` on the
  same typed lockfile-strict Node hydration path. It is deliberately `narrowing` for
  `selected_runtime_version`, not an executable/image-digest acquittal.
- The current V11.10 cut adds the first immutable runtime-artifact carrier. Receipts
  recover literal digest-pinned Compose `image` values only for explicitly selected services in
  explicitly declared files and their declared Compose `depends_on` closure as
  `selected_runtime_artifact`; receipt diff treats a matching digest as `acquitting` only for that
  named artifact. Mutable tags, interpolation, inferred files, and unrelated stack services remain
  outside the claim. Immich pressure also exposed and fixed an Ota runner gap: Compose adapter-file
  preflight now resolves files relative to the same adapter `cwd` used by execution. The narrow
  Redis/PostgreSQL launch, status, and stop path passed locally with the source-built binary.
- Immich and Grafana confirmed the follow-on taxonomy need. `effects.network_kind:
  container_image_hydration` now owns registry-backed Compose image acquisition independently from
  package dependency hydration; `prepare.medium: container_images` requires this label, doctor and
  policy packs expose the same lane, and immutable image receipt evidence remains separate from
  the effect declaration.
- The same branch upgraded the direct `quick-xml` dependency to `0.41.0` after `cargo deny`
  surfaced the two XML denial-of-service advisories in `0.38.4`; the NuGet feed-provenance parser
  uses the current XML 1.0 attribute-normalization API and its focused tests pass.
- Grafana confirmed the receipt carrier on a mixed Compose stack with locally built, mutable, and
  digest-pinned services. The selected observability lane records four explicit digest-pinned
  services plus `tempo-init` through Tempo's declared `depends_on` closure, while excluding
  unrelated built and mutable stack services. This exposed and fixed the closure-recovery gap in
  Ota rather than leaving the init image absent from a selected runtime receipt.
- The same Grafana pass exposed and fixed a doctor semver gap: whitespace-separated compound
  ranges such as `>=1.26.3 <1.27` now use the canonical normalized semver path while preserving
  Ota's established shorthand comparator behavior.

## Handoff To The Next Chat

Start by reading `AGENTS.md`, this file, the canonical Ota skill, and
`docs/planning/v11.10/plan.md` plus `docs/planning/v11.11/plan.md`. Then run `git status --short` in `ota`, `ota-site`,
`/Users/bobai/Workspace/Ota.run/skills`, and the active pressure repo before editing.

The continuity batch immediately before this handoff added the canonical pressure-testing protocol,
required a connected-surface decision for Ota changes, and synchronized the skill into the global
Codex and agent skill stores. Its installation smoke test could not run locally because this
machine does not currently provide `node` or `npx`; source integrity was verified with diff and
shell-syntax checks.

Finish V11.10 replay trust and V11.11 proof-boundary enforcement before starting V11.12 hydration
provenance or returning to V11.13 generated-artifact breadth. For V11.11, the next proof gate is
Athena's existing PostgreSQL negative control: validate that its matrix emits a canonical control
record with a transaction-bound `expected_missing_effect` failure mode, while malformed or
unclassified controls retain `dependency_causality_not_proved`. Do not infer generated-file
freshness from timestamps or later filesystem reads. Follow the pressure-testing protocol exactly
and record whether the repo exposes a contract issue, implementation issue, or Ota platform gap.

## Working Rules

- Read the canonical Ota skill before Ota-specific work.
- Use `references/pressure-testing-protocol.md` for every pressure pass.
- Make and record the connected-surface decision for core docs, examples, skills, and site.
- Use released Ota versions for released proof; use the active branch only for explicit unreleased
  pressure testing.
